# Project-JobBoard
A job portal application written in C# using WPF.

As our first OOP project, we kind of got carried away and tried to use many techniques and technologies
that we were unfamiliar with, while having a very short timeframe. As a result, the code is a giant mess 
that we wouldn't deploy in a production environment without some serious refactoring, but it was also a 
great learning experience, one that taught us things that goes beyond just the C# language.
